# Smart Predictive Modelling for Healthcare

## Overview
The Smart Predictive Modelling for Healthcare project aims to enhance healthcare outcomes by providing a comprehensive system for predicting critical health conditions. This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diseases such as lung cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, thyroid disorders, and diabetes. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the system assists healthcare providers in the early identification and mitigation of health risks, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

## Project Objectives
- **Early Prediction**: Develop a system to predict lung cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, thyroid disorders, and diabetes.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilize robust data preprocessing techniques to ensure high-quality input data for analysis.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Employ sophisticated machine learning algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy and reliability.

## Key Tasks
### Data Preprocessing:

- **Feature Scaling**: Normalize data to ensure consistent scale across features.
- **Feature Selection**: Select relevant features to improve model performance and reduce overfitting.

### Model Development:

- **Decision Trees**: Implement decision tree algorithms for their interpretability and simplicity.
- **Random Forests**: Use random forests for robust predictions and handling large datasets.
- **Logistic Regression**: Apply logistic regression for binary classification tasks.

## Repository Structure
The repository contains the following files and directories:

- Datasets/: Contains the datasets used for training and testing the models.
- Models/: Includes saved models and related files.
- Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for predicting heart disease using machine learning models.
